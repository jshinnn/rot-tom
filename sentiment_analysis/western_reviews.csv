m/1000123-310_to_yuma,A taut Western (obviously inspired by High Noon) about a lone man bravely standing on principle when all others have abandoned him. Marred only by a phony ending.,3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"
m/1000123-310_to_yuma,"It's of necessity a talkative film, with Ford working on Heflin's nerves in a stream of Machiavellian banter, but one held in perfect balance by Daves, who keeps the tension strung taut.",3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"
m/1000123-310_to_yuma,This is a first-rate action picture -- a respectable second section to High Noon.,3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"
m/1000123-310_to_yuma,The enjoyment here that outweighs the film's derivativeness comes in the dialogue and relationship developed between outlaw and rancher.,3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"
m/1000123-310_to_yuma,"Made in the vein of The Gunfighter and High Noon, this mature psychological Western is arguably Delmer Daves best film, featuring Van Heflin (in the Gary Cooper role) and Glenn Ford as the bad-good guy at their most appealing and accomplished.",3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"
m/1000123-310_to_yuma,"That the climax fizzles must be laid on doorstep of Halsted Welles, who adapts Elmore Leonard's story quite well until that point.",3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"

m/1000123-310_to_yuma,"The minutes tick toward 3:10, and all we can do is watch and hope that it all turns out ok. That's the best kind of Western, one that allows feelings like that to emerge while watching.",3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"

m/1000123-310_to_yuma,"Although not as nerve-wracking as High Noon, 3:10 to Yuma is even more claustrophobic… and the two-character drama is more intriguing than High Noon's protagonist standing alone.",3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"

m/1000123-310_to_yuma,"Like The Gunfighter and Winchester '73, 3:10 to Yuma is one of those defining '50s Westerns that is well-known by film buffs but has never reached the familiarity level of a High Noon or Shane.",3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"
m/1000123-310_to_yuma,The compositions evoke a kind of open-air claustrophobia ...,3:10 to Yuma,"['Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"

m/1000560-alamo,"As his own producer and director, Mr. Wayne has unfortunately let his desire to make a ""big"" picture burden him with dialogue. His action scenes are usually vivid, his talk scenes are long and usually dull.",The Alamo,"['Action & Adventure', 'Classics', 'Drama', 'Western']"

m/10008613-burrowers,Director J.T Petty's nasty romp followed up Alex Turner's Dead Birds (2004) and preceeded John Geddes Exit Humanity (2011) in the Old West/monster movie mash-up genre; it may well be the best of them.,The Burrowers,"['Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense', 'Western']"

m/10008785-appaloosa,"Old fashioned Western, a meditation on honor, courage and camaraderie, is well helmed and acted, but commercially, it might fall between the cracks: It's too grown-up for young viewers and too familiar as a psychological Western for adults.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"A finely textured, riveting Western that marks a welcome return to a classic American genre. Bristles with violence and humanity",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"

m/10008785-appaloosa,"While he thankfully avoids the actor-filmmaker avenger fantasies of The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Harris doesn't have the genre chops to fill Appaloosa's empty spaces.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"Appaloosa is a pleasingly spacious piece of work, but for all of its little tangles it never musters the kick of a psychological duel.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,Appaloosa demonstrates a better sense of history than Paul Thomas Anderson's hysterical There Will Be Blood. But Harris isn't a good enough director; he loses the mythical air that drives home a great Western's point.,Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"Ed Harris reunites with Viggo Mortensen, his co-star in A History of Violence, and the chemistry is easygoing and understated. But he should have left the direction to someone else.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,It's high time for the western to be resuscitated as a genre; a picture that just pokes along amiably isn't enough to get the job done.,Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"The bullets may not be comparable to the Yuma remake or Kevin Costner's underrated Open Range, but the men holding the guns are still the same. So what if they're just a little bit different?",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"too authentic to be populist, yet too familiar to transcend the genre and hang with the bona fide classics.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"

m/10008785-appaloosa,"Crackling eccentric verbal wit as Harris' marshal seeks to 'button up this town tighter than a nun's corset' while overcome by Zellweger's irresistible flirty charms, because she 'chews her food nicely and even takes a bath before going to bed.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,Appaloosa satisfies all its requirements but never breaks a sweat.,Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"It could be said that Harris and his co-writer, Robert Knott, haven't done a whole lot of writing, but as Cole himself might say, there's no need to get all fancy with what's plain and true.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"Appaloosa has a solid enough opening, and it should be fun just to watch things play out, what with the shootouts, the trains, the swagger at gunpoint. But the script (co-written by Harris) is alternately dumb and lifeless.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"Appaloosa will probably just ride off into the sunset without much of an impact, but it will sate your fix for horses, guns and slapping leather. You know, if you're into that sort of thing.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"

m/10008785-appaloosa,Harris follows his strong helming debut Pollock with a contribution to the western movie revival that looks and sounds like a classic.,Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"Ed Harris has the kind of head that would look great on a coin, but it looks even better on a movie screen, as he turns his chiseled features this way and that.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"

m/10008785-appaloosa,"A smart and funny script, highly entertaining from the first draw, Appaloosa is a taut, captivating tale of the old West with enough bite and modern edge to draw in both fans and non-devotees of the cowboy genre.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"
m/10008785-appaloosa,"Jeremy Irons is miscast as the film's politically driven baddie, but the easy rapport between Harris and Mortensen more than compensates for the minor misstep.",Appaloosa,"['Action & Adventure', 'Western']"

m/10008785-appaloosa,"A classics-steeped western that rams home tradition over reinvention, Appaloosa kicks it hard as a buddy pic on horseback.
