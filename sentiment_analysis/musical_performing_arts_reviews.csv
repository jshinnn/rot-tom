m/10009632-notorious,"Notorious is a pretty standard biopic, and is probably largely compromised. If you've never seen Nick Broomfield's excellent 2002 doco Biggie And Tupac, you'd be better served hunting that down instead.",Notorious,"['Drama', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009632-notorious,"While it's now less a case of race than class in black film, Notorious seems to still be taking tabloid cues more from alien ghetto underclass drama and what's come before, rather than bringing new and improved insight to the table beyond the cool music.",Notorious,"['Drama', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009632-notorious,There's not many surprises here for fans of the big man or those new to his work but the music is great and a major + point is that Sean 'Puffy' Combs (Derek Luke) is the film's producer.,Notorious,"['Drama', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009632-notorious,This so-bad-it's-actually-almost-brilliant biopic has an endearingly dodgy way of softening up hard facts.,Notorious,"['Drama', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,Soul Men is the most disappointing tribute to black pop music since the OutKast movie Idlewild.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,If the Weinsteins had any soul themselves they would take this film and bury it along with every other film they seem to these days instead of trying to cash it in as some misbegotten tribute to Bernie Mac's legacy.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"It'd be a step up if we could call this a poor Odd Couple knockoff, but it's not even that good: it's more like a juvenile grossout comedy for oldsters...",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,"It doesn't sound like the likeliest pairing, but it works surprisingly well. Samuel L. Jackson and the late Bernie Mac make a winning duo in the bawdy buddy road-trip picture Soul Men.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"Anyone who had affection for the late Bernie Mac would have a hard time not enjoying his last performance, no matter how cliched and trite this buddy road movie is.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,A muddled effort that strains to come together.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"The movie crams in myriad needless subplots -- ostensibly to provide padding, which only draws attention to how thin the original story really is.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,The flick is nothing special but it is a great light for Bernie Mac to go out on. He was able to be as filthy as possible.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,What keeps this medium-grade formula picture from coming to a complete stop are the precious crumbs of genuinely funny comedic banter between well-paired stars Samuel Jackson and Bernie Mac.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"In spite of its title, the film has precious little soul, but its real offense is being Mac's final on screen credit.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"'Soul Men' is not only a tribute to Mac and Hayes, but the film is also funny, often outrageously crude, and pleasurable.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,"Bernie Mac's penultimate feature is a soul movie with genuine heart, a crowd-pleasing comedy that leans more heavily toward laughs for the majority of the running time, yet still manages to draw the viewer in with a slightly more earnest subplot.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,Samuel L. Jackson continues his tradition of inventive facial hair in Soul Men. And his tradition of appearing in movies unworthy of his talent.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,The only good reason to see the otherwise dismal comedy Soul Men is to have a look at the late actor and comedian Bernie Mac in one of his final screen roles.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,"Sort of a riff on The Sunshine Boys with hints of Dreamgirls, about all Malcolm D.

m/10009635-soul_men,"It grieves me to report that Bernie Mac's posthumous movie release, Soul Men, hardly does the great comedian justice.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"Ultimately, Soul Men achieves modest goals comedically and soars high musically, and it deserves credit for that.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"That Soul Men proves an entertaining-enough diversion has less to do with the pedestrian screenplay and direction than the high-wattage, crowd-pleasing showmanship of Mac and co-star Samuel L. Jackson.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,Mac and Jackson clearly have such a blast singing and dancing you can't help but feel their groove. The rest of the movie should have jived as well.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,"There's a raunchy energy to Soul Men that cannot be denied. Even if the film is derivative, predictable, visibly low-budget and crude, it's also darn funny a good deal of the time.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"There's nothing here you haven't seen before, but the genuine and infectious chemistry between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Mac and the irresistible energy of their performances is more than enough to give the movie real heft and momentum.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,Mac was a magnetic performer with a long history of redeeming mediocre movies; unfortunately this is another one.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"Samuel L. Jackson and Bernie Mac appear to be having a good time, and for most of this raunchy, poorly orchestrated buddy comedy, that's enough.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,"When it succeeds, it's because of Mac and Jackson, two performers who give their all even when the material is measly.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"

m/10009635-soul_men,"A tender, tangy and wild tale in a kooky convergence of music, memory and male bonding blues. And a movie truly about lasting impressions, where you're very likely to laugh till you cry, when not the other way around.",Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
m/10009635-soul_men,A definite + is the sense of nostalgia generated by the movie's postscript affectionately acknowledging the passing of both Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes.,Soul Men,"['Comedy', 'Musical & Performing Arts']"
