m/10004659-arthur,The bucolic wonder buried in Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles has been snuffed out by this alienating and dislikable animated film. As overproduced and acrid as The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc and The Fifth Element.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,Besson drags things out considerably for his young audience at 122 minutes. The CG work is clever but cannot measure up to Pixar's standards in cleverness or imagination. Nothing is fresh here.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"The film touts its 'dazzling' hybrid of live action and 'groundbreaking' CGI, but the visuals can't compare to Happy Feet or any Pixar release.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,The underground adventures are an unfortunate mixture of po-mo snark and potty humor (some just plain pot humor as well).,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"Luc Besson, the most-Hollywoodish of Gallic directors, has adapted his own series of popular (in France) kid-lit tomes to produce a glossy, expensive ($84 million) and long-winded mix of live action and computer animation.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"A mishmash with a distinctive but disorderly animation palette whose top-notch voice cast -- including Robert De Niro, Madonna and David Bowie -- gets lost in the muck.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,... a stiff affair that mixes overripe live action and starchy CGI animation.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"This children's epic is slowed considerably by a convoluted, multi-tiered plotline in which we bounce between the human world and the Minimoy one. None of the characters are compelling, despite the star-studded vocal cast behind them.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"There's no time to sort out the players or the story as things rush ahead at an overwrought pace.

m/10004659-arthur,This mix of computer animation and live action promises much but never really comes together. Haphazard voice dubbing and lack of originality don't help.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"The adventure turns out to be a drag. When Arthur goes on a ruby hunt, the movie shifts to animation, and he meets the Minimoys, fairy creatures who look like those troll dolls that become inexplicably popular every 20 years.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Arthur and the Invisibles makes an excellent case against casting animated movies with celebrity voices. There are people who make their living as voiceover artists, and they would have been infinitely better than the lackluster Robert De Niro.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Luc Besson has never been one of my favorite filmmakers, but he seems to have found his metier in children's fantasy, and this semianimated adventure is enjoyable and imaginative despite its formulaic qualities.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"Succumbing to the in-joke trend popular in children's films, Luc Besson's visually attractive movie spoils its own fantasy spell with anachronistic references and a quickly resolved story line.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"While technically polished and adequately executed Arthur, like most of Besson's movies, is a strangely soulless experience.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Besson is a pro when it comes to action movies, but this part live, part animation effort is a mess, highlighted by creepy animation, derivative plot points and a child star who speaks way too fast.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"The story [Besson] co-wrote for Arthur is workable, even clever at times, but the visualization of the Minimoys and their crib is weird and almost aggressively off-putting -- like an episode of When CGI Attacks!",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,The film jumps and starts all over the place and simply isn't cohesive enough to appeal much beyond youngsters.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy who shrinks to microscopic size to find his missing grandfather.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"There's a reason American animated filmmakers don't use the great Robert De Niro, Jason Bateman and Madonna to voice their cartoons. These big names add nothing to this frustrating goulash of fairy tales and fantasy-film ingredients.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,This kids' cartoon from France is such a surreally demented attempt to connect with children that it's the equivalent of foie gras breakfast cereal or a bleu cheese milkshake.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"It might have been just another humdrum children's film if not for Highmore, who brings the same charm he did in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Finding Neverland to this fun movie.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Directed by Luc Besson, this inventive family movie sets up the most delightful premise, then squanders it on the kind of yawn-inducing CG adventure you might expect from one of those long, plot-heavy cut scenes that slow down video games.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"They look like a cross between anime and Jim Henson puppets. Fortunately, they look nothing like Pixar, PDI, Sony Animation or any of the other talking animal companies.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Apparently Besson became so enamored of CG animation's possibilities that he forgot basic rules ... such as the one about animation thriving on clear-cut, distinctive characters whose personalities are established in the first few seconds they're on screen.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"The movie is too long by half for its relatively simple plot. And letting kids get antsy, as any parent can tell you, is the biggest sin a filmmaker can commit.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Arthur and the Invisibles may be a tale for children, but it's got the bad habits of a profligate adult -- the thing borrows shamelessly from its betters and then pretends to be self-sustaining.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"The movie bing-bing-bings all over the place, repurposing fantasy novels, video games, Arthurian legends. Besson's grocery bill for all I know.

m/akron,"Akron is a nice try at normalizing gay romance, but the filmmaking needs the erotic and spiritual masculine energy of great gay cinema.",Akron,"['Drama', 'Kids & Family', 'Romance']"

m/aladdin,Your wish for a respectful and enjoyable new Aladdin has been granted.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The result is actually surprisingly restrained and sweet.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Brims with colorful, lavish set and costume design along with mostly exhilarating musical numbers, but the story beyond the music falls flat because it fails to pack an emotional punch and often becomes dull. It pales compared to the animated classic.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,This is easily the hyperkinetic director's most sedate feature.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Does it possess the same magic as the original animation? Short answer: yes - in buckets.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The cast do what they can to find some heart within the stiff material.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Today, ""Aladdin"" is a Disney movie, or a Guy Ritchie movie. But I wouldn't be surprised if, in five years, ""Aladdin"" is thought of as the film where Naomi Scott broke through.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,It's the modifications in Ritchie's enjoyable take on Aladdin that ultimately justifies its existence-even if it bends a few nails in the execution.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Ritchie knows what to preserve, and what to enhance. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and the resulting ""Aladdin"" is fun, celebratory and yes, nostalgic.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin is a jubilant and energetic Disney retelling that mostly succeeds in updating the animated version, even if it never feels quite as magical.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Guy Ritchie's live-action remake is content to trace the original's narrative beats with perfunctory indifference.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"When the movie branched off and did its own thing, I enjoyed it. But it tries to emulate what came before it and does it in a way that is just not as good or effective as the original animation.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"[Aladdin] pulls off its modest ambitions, hitting the story beats and retaining the songs of the beloved classic amidst a gorgeous production design, but that doesn't stop the film from feeling less like a movie and more of a corporate product.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin tries but never kicks into second gear. With more focus on the musical flair, this had potential to be a top tier outing. Doesn't reach those levels, and never sees a whole new world.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,A notably entertaining romp that rather quickly finds the limits of corporate wokeness.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It's got a flying carpet. It's got an enchanted lamp. It's got a shape-shifting genie. But alas, ""Aladdin"" lacks real magic.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The movie itself, while not entirely terrible - a lot of craft has been purchased, and even a little art - is pointless in a particularly aggressive way.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"[Aladdin] is too long, and some of the musical sequences come up lacking, but the cast is strong, the production feels big, and magic carpets are always cool.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"As Aladdin disastrously tries to court Princess Jasmine, he turns to Genie and asks how he is doing. His response is ""clumsy but charming"", and there is no more succinct description of this live-action Disney remake",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"This is ""filmmaking"" as black magic - the result of someone burying the original Aladdin V/H/S in a Pet Sematary.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Although Ritchie's film hews extremely close to the colourful aesthetics of Disney's classic 'toon, as well as hitting all the same story beats, it does at least attempt to freshen things up.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Nobody could match Williams, with the possible exception of Will Smith, who comes within a hairsbreadth of doing just that, which in itself is an amazing accomplishment.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Kids who are unfamiliar with the animated classic will most likely find it magical, and even adults will surely be charmed. It is a version of Aladdin, after all.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The terrible musical sequences, the lackluster CGI, and the strange creative and emotional restraint that permeates the film frequently flatten Disney's original Aladdin into a cardboard version of itself.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"With eager charm and tenacity, Aladdin stumbles into pleasant territory. It's more style than substance, though.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Filled with dazzling visual effects, magnificently staged musical numbers, and characters that will resonate with all ages. Aladdin is the first big surprise of the summer movie season. I'm still humming Alan Menken's thundering ballad, ""Prince Ali.""",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Ritchie's Aladdin is a whole old world, almost a scene-for-scene remake, except this time with three comprehensively dull actors playing Aladdin, Jasmine, and Jafar.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"A vibrant, charming adaptation that further proves Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott are ones to watch. If the promos haven't worked for you, keep an open mind. Ultimately what matters is that those moments work in the full feature and in this case, they do.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Even with a colossal budget and the spectacular tech available to Disney, live actors can't replicate the dizzy kinetics of a cartoon.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The songs need to skyrocket and the dance moves should sweep us off our feet. In this era of corporate nostalgia, the least a movie like Aladdin could get is a protector. Hell, a friend.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Guy Ritchie's Aladdin reimagining is ultimately a magic carpet ride you won't mind experiencing.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"A throwback to the 1950s and the heyday of the MGM musical, when various countries and cultures were packaged into vibrant confections of song, dance, exotic sets and costumes... Ritchie has come up with something that fits right in.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"I was shocked at how fantastic Aladdin was. I would even go so far as to say that this is one of, if not the best, live-action adaptations that Disney has released thus far.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"""Aladdin"" is a great deal of fun, with charming leads and elaborately mounted songs.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,I got so bored I started to scribble new songs myself in the dark.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"There are just some things that should not exist in this world, and Smith's visage pasted onto a floating, endlessly stretchy blue cloud of CGI muscles and sinew is top of the list. So, yeah: pure nightmare fuel.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The film's signature song, the Oscar-winning ""Whole New World,"" fares a bit better and Massoud and Scott sing their hearts out to great affect. Overall, Aladdin has flashes of greatness but ends up an overlong retread.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It's a dancing elephant of a movie. It has a few decent moves, but you'd never call it light on its feet.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"While there's a certain charm missing from the revamp, Smith goes way over the top to make up for it.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"With Massoud, Aladdin hits that sweet spot all these remakes are aiming for... If only the rest of the film had been up to his level, this could have been a new classic.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Once Aladdin finds its groove, it slots itself firmly as fun, escapist entertainment, but it never really addresses the emphatic nature by which it needed to exist in the first place.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The surprisingly not-awful remake has its share of clunky patches, but it's a bright, breezy bit of kiddie entertainment.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The results aren't exactly magical...Heck, I'd even take a low-rent theme-park version if it spared me this film's descent into the uncanny valley.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Gets most of its key elements right, but the Will Smith performance as the Genie is full of miscalculations large and small. (Philly Voice)",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"While it'll never replace the near perfection of the original film, Aladdin has the kind of grand spectacle a younger generation expects from a trip to the movies and simultaneously takes their parents on a magic carpet ride back to their youths.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Keep your expectations in check and you won't be disappointed.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The new Aladdin does have a fun energy and charm... but all of those positives are simply borrowed, and there is a very real and notable limit to its creative energy.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It felt like glitzy cruise ship renditions of the iconic sequences, more concerned with checking off boxes instead of digging into a deep manic energy to make us laugh and smile.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"This film is desperate to please, and trying very hard to do so. And it comes up short almost every chance it gets.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Despite stellar casting for its two lead roles, the remake of the 1992 Oscar-winning animated movie suffers from the lack of a superb villain who can equally carry the film.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"What a different, livelier movie this would be if Smith got jiggy with ['A Friend Like Me'], and applied some ""Fresh Prince"" rap stylings.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The screenplay is a mess, but 'Aladdin' gets by on its production values and dynamite star turns. I knew Noami Scott was the real deal, but Mena Massoud is a revelation.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"This isn't a movie. It's a chintzy revival, specifically designed to appeal to audiences who think ""that looks familiar"" qualifies as entertainment.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"A delightful surprise, very much part of a ""set"" with Disney's live action Beauty & The Beast. Smith, Massoud & Scott all shine. A great family movie AND a date movie!",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"This is a Jasmine with a voice and a message, both of which are stunningly highlighted in a new song created for the movie: ""Speechless""",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The new material folds well enough into the existing material. Tragically little of this matters, because the musical numbers are staged and edited as if director Ritchie had never even seen a musical.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,It's a whole new world for Aladdin...,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,There is enough new to this world to make it a worthwhile revisiting of what is now a timeless Disney classic. Will Smith is funny as the Genie and the story has a deeper emotional appeal than the original.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Where there should be wonder, there is CGI. And where there should be a fun and exciting comedic presence with the Genie, we get Will Smith doing his best Kazaam impression.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,Doubts about Will Smith's casting as the Genie are overblown. It's the guy behind the camera who should be doubted. And stuffed into a small lamp forever.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Much like the previous Disney live-action offerings of late, Aladdin is tastelessly inoffensive. Just decent enough that your kids won't be disappointed, but not good enough to immediately order the Blu-Ray for future viewings.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"What's old is new again - but not quite as good as you remembered it. Aladdin is...fine, but it has no real reason for being beyond, you know, capitalism.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"""If you expect magic in this carpet ride, you're going to get rolled.""",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin is a dazzling magical ride filled with new surprises. Will Smith is entertaining and hilarious, truly making his own mark on this infamous role. Naomi Scott was born to play Jasmine and shines effortlessly in every musical number she's in.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The combination of diverse casting and female empowerment themes results in a perfectly politically correct Aladdin for these times.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Ritchie's style embraces the kind of expressionism needed to pull off such a fanciful tale.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,A remake that can't hold a lamp to the original.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"Aside from a couple of caveats, take a chance on this diamond in the rough. Bravo to Disney and Guy Ritchie for making this film kid friendly for families!",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Massoud's carefree demeanor and world-class grin are a perfect match for the ""street rat"" who dreams of bigger things, and the fierce determination Scott brings to the role of Jasmine is a welcome change from the usual damsel in distress archetype.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,It's the diamond in the rough live-action film that balances nostalgia with a fresh (prince?) view on a Disney classic. And I'm here for the magic carpet ride.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

No. But it does prove the enduring magic of this story, even in a whole new world.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"It may have helped that the negative buzz around the film had our expectations pretty low, but Aladdin is one of cinema's most pleasant surprises of 2019.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Though it hews reasonably closely to the plot of the 1992 film...this oversized remake manages to jettison much of the original's charm and cleverness.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Perhaps the most appropriate word to describe Disney's 2019 re-make of their 1992 classic, Aladdin, is ""unnecessary."" ""Pointless"" might also apply.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Did Aladdin just get woke? It's an inspired choice to cast Guy Ritchie's live-action version of Disney's 1992 animated hit with persons of color. What a shame that the end result gets buried in a blanket of bland.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"Aladdin sure is a Fresh Prince Ali. It has a lot of fun with the animated classic in a live-action context and by casting middle eastern actors, gives Naomi Scott, Mena Massoud and Marwan Kenzari a well-earned breakthrough showcase.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It has barely a modicum of the crackle and fizz of its cartoon predecessor, from which the filmmaker's entire knowledge of the Middle East appears to have been drawn",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,There's an artificiality to the proceedings here that both strips [Guy] Ritchie's directorial presence of any identity and hinders the film in a manner of aesthetic naturality.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"Guy Ritchie fails to mesh his own style with that of the hand-drawn classic, resulting in an Aladdin remake that's an exquisite corpse of CGI nonsense.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Unfortunately, Aladdin doesn't make any meaningful effort to depict the Middle Eastern way of life.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"When the giant CGI Will Smith is bouncing around, it doesn't work...but when he plays himself, he's very charming, the best part of the movie...the actors are trying to break free, but some of the dialogue and performances are cringe-worthy.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"I can enjoy both versions for different reasons, and I would gladly do a double-feature with both Aladdins...but one of the better Disney live-action remakes.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It's a largely unremarkable, mindless sea of CGI and sand dunes...",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,The role of Jasmine transforms from the strong damsel-in-distress female needing Aladdin to rescue her to the budding political leader of her country in which Aladdin becomes her partner rather than her savior.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Where the film really shines is in its musical numbers. The eminently hummable songs of composer Alan Menken and lyricists Howard Ashman and Tim Rice are given lavish music video treatment.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The messages and subtexts about the need to be yourself are gooey, grating and oh-so-Disney, but the songs are even more annoying...",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin isn't the worst of Disney's live-action remakes, this is true; it's just an inoffensive, somewhat slapdash restaging.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The film - sans its minor hiccups - is congenial and establishes the 'feel-good' factor from frame one and maintains it till the curtains are drawn.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Director Guy Ritchie deploys his usual arsenal of flashy effects but adds nothing to the story of the thief with the heart of gold.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The musical doesn't so much reimagine the classic tale as shellack a layer of Hollywood spectacle onto it.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The film is not absolutely dreadful. It's just not original or fascinating which is not a punishable offense in most states.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Considering that expectations were on the floor, Aladdin manages to be equal parts entertaining, enjoyable, and charming.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Despite its familiarity, something is amiss in Guy Ritchie's soapy, bland rehash.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"One ponders why a film that has committed so much money to creating effects then skimped on everything else. One further ponders why Disney tasked Guy Ritchie, known for the gritty action flick, with directing a musical aimed squarely at the kiddies.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"There are efforts made, whether through good faith or just market savvy, to update Princess Jasmine into a people's champion who might prefer ruling to romance. Enough to make you wish the Disney people had gone whole hog and just called it Jasmine.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"There's no... real reason for a remake, other than the very rare chance that a remake is going to be better than the original. Like most, Aladdin isn't. But it is momentarily diverting, in a pleasant way.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin is still an enjoyable film with vibrant colours, a lovable Genie and you will still get the Disney feel. It falls short due to Ritchie's indecisive direction and wooden acting from Scott and Massoud.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Taken in context, the new Aladdin is OK, but not great.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Ritchie failed to bring his signature style to this forgettable Disney reboot.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The nonhuman element (Abu) is great; there is also a perfectly charming Magic Carpet. There is just an unfortunate shortage of magic.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The greatest failure of this Aladdin is that, like our blue-dipped Genie, it possesses incredible power but fumbles it, playing too safe when every beat, specifically every musical one, should have dazzled.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Ritchie's rendition of a Disney cash cow may not be the kind of magic carpet ride that transports you to entertainment's most magical realms...,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"The live-action remake of Aladdin isn't ""a whole new world"" of storytelling, but it still makes for an overall enjoyable watch",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Naomi Scott... is particularly effective as Princess Jasmine and the special effects are consistently watchable.

m/aladdin,"Utterly unnecessary, but not charmless.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"If you're a fan of the original, one has to wonder, why not just watch that? Why indulge the company's incessant need to churn out this endless parade of karaoke cosplays instead of giving us whole new worlds?",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"""Aladdin"" is more a star vehicle for Smith than the original was for Robin Williams. Though Smith is energetic, his Genie isn't half as good with twice the on-screen presence.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin is definitely cheesy and messy, as cynically produced as the other live-action fare...but where that cheese is allowed to manifest into a distinct work of art driven by a great collection of performances, it's actually a pretty fun time.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It's infinitely better than the stage version, but not quite on par with the animated feature. Still, it's a fine film for the fam to see over Memorial Day weekend.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"For those who have enjoyed the animated version, this film is just as fun.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,The insanely colorful costumes and amazing special effects do their part.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"If you were ever going to remake ""Aladdin"" - as beloved as it is - without the incredible Robin Williams playing the lovable Genie, I'd say 2019's version is probably the best adaptation you could wish for.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,It does make me wish Guy Ritchie had not tried so desperately to walk the line between a conventional Aladdin remake and something with a little more pizazz.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Smith understandably didn't want to compete with Williams, but as the big, blue, top-knotted Genie, he's uncharacteristically bland. Even the magic carpet in this movie looks bummed out.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Because the new film's magic carpet is following in the flight plan of its animated ancestor, it can't reach new heights on its own.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Director Guy Ritchie's hackwork in this musical adventure film performs sleight of hand, moving so fast that his razzle-dazzle blurs any sense of personal ethnic insight.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Heavy on CGI glitz at the expense of emotional substance, this new version tends to feel more like sensory overload than a magic-carpet ride.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,It's an ambitious undertaking on a grand scale and one that pays off.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,A tragic carpet ride.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Smartly, Ritchie, working from a script he co-wrote with John August (""Dark Shadows,"" ""Big Fish""), does not stray far from the original material. Their script adds some girl power, which is fine by me.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Ritchie's vision has a slight lethargy problem, but that's smoothed out once Will Smith's mystical matchmaker is summoned forward.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The 2019 version is nothing more than a fun and often times silly version of this tale, and the live action bits can't really ever commit to either being an earnest love story or a cartoonish romp for kids to enjoy.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Is Aladdin perfect? No. Is it much better than we all thought it would be? Yes.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It runs 128 minutes - though it has enough digressions, chases, musical numbers and virtual fly-overs through bazaars, minaret-and-domed skylines, that is feels it may actually last 1001 Nights.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The question most asked is how does Will Smith do as the genie? The simple answer? He's not Robin Williams. Plus, the original ran 90-minutes. This one is a bloated 2:08.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Disney needs three wishes for its live-action ""Aladdin"" remake: for a better Genie, a better script and a soul.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,It's fun. Bring a kid.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"Fantasy, comedy, music, adventure, thrills""Aladdin"" has got it all. This is a remake to be proud of, a resplendently imagined family feature that lives up toand, in some crucial empowering ways, surpassesthe animated original.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"If I had a magic lamp and three wishes, after the whole ending war and famine stuff, I'd use one to wish that Disney think long and hard about these live-action remakes.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Smith hasn't been this entertaining for years.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Despite being one of the most unambitious tentpole films of the year, the live-action Aladdin is - by far - the oddest movie that director Guy Ritchie has ever made. And remember, he once made a rom-com for his ex-wife Madonna.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,This is something that no one wished for.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"Refreshing and splendidly shimmering - not Disney's best but an entertaining interlude, destined to become a new Adventureland ride.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Save for an energetic Will Smith performance and some peppy tunes, Guy Ritchie's Aladdin is a soulless, plastic-injected facsimile of the 1992 animated classic.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"After what we've seen and heard from the late, great Robin Williams, Will Smith's act -- even with some special effects -- wears thin rather quickly.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"The movie is filled with humor and action, and the three major production numbers are spectacularly performed and filmed. It is one of the best films so far in 2019.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Will Smith holds up better than might have been expected following in Robin Williams shoes. You know a film has an uphill battle when that comparison is the first of many going into a film.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Overall, it was a fun film, an OK film, but not one that leaves much of an impression.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Improves on the original in no way whatsoever and is only palatable if you've never seen the other one.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin is a family fun film that has just enough magic to entertain fans of the original, despite a few flaws.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The Egyptian-born Mena Massoud makes a convincing Aladdin, the British-born Naomi Scott is photogenic and tuneful as Jasmine, and Ritchie delivers the big musical numbers with surprising aplomb.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Ritchie's Aladdin struggles to find its own voice while constantly serving the narrative of its source material.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,A weird mess of vaguely woke film-making and cultural appropriation on the DeMille scale.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Better than expected. The cast makes it work.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Not the worst of Disney's live-action remakes, but it's certainly one of the laziest; a bloated cash-cow that is as tedious as it is ponderous.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"Guy Ritchie's ""Aladdin"" remake introduces kids to new methods to 'get their way' by torturing Jasmine's dad, the Sultan-this will never be 'okay' in a children's movie.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The new telling brings little that feels essential, and the missing elements-chiefly, the controlled chaos and unbridled comedy of the late Robin Williams' vocal performance-have given the film's candy-colored visual palate a homesick pall.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Surprisingly very decent with three good leads and some lovely visuals. It's just a shame the editing hadn't been more ruthless and the new songs weren't more memorable.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"What a frustration, though, that in the 27 years from when the animated version of Aladdin was a cultural phenomenon, Disney still can't figure out a way to remove the Orientalism.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin gets a pass thanks to the undeniable charm of its star, Mena Massoud.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,Aladdin is the rare remake that actually gives us a whole new world.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"I get that Disney intends to target the American audience first.

m/aladdin,"With the exception of the magnificent ""A Whole New World"" sequence where title character Aladdin and Princess Jasmine ride a magic carpet across the fictional city of Agrabah, Disney's Aladdin is a CGI-heavy bore.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"If you need a laugh, or you need to be dazzled, or you just need to recapture some childlike joy and wonder, Aladdin might turn out to be just what you need.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"A truly beautiful film with laughs and incredible sights and sounds galore; maybe it was unnecessary, but it isn't unnoteworthy.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The musical numbers are immaculately staged, like you just wandered into a ""Bollywood"" production. And while this film is about 40-minutes longer than it's animated predecessor, it doesn't suffer under the crush of added time like the recent ""Dumbo.""",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Disney distracts,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Has barely a modicum of the crackle and fizz of its cartoon predecessor, from which the filmmaker's entire knowledge of the Middle East appears to have been drawn",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"I never thought I'd say this, but I'd like to see another movie musical by Guy Ritchie. Huh. [Full review in Spanish]",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,Aladdin is ... OK. Not terrible. Not great. Just OK. And that bland meh-ness is maybe the worst place it could have landed; we're left with a movie that is almost defined by how unnecessary it feels.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"Guy Ritchie is a talented filmmaker, but he forgets that just because things look cool, doesn't mean it will feel cool. Or any emotion really.

m/aladdin,"This is a big-hearted, laugh-out-loud romp with swooning romance and exhilarating action sequences. Kids will love it; adults will pretend they don't.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The scenes that venture away from the source material are so dull and unmemorable that all you're left with are much worse live-action versions of your favorite Aladdin songs.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,...one cannot help but see this recycling of a beloved festive fable as nothing but an opportunistic money grab. Today's Aladdin should have rubbed its own lamp and wished for the flavored footnotes of its legendary animated counterpart from yesteryear.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Aladdin reaffirms the studio's tendency to work like an assembly line. [Full Review in Spanish],Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"This Aladdin is loud, cheery, tacky, and vacuously good-natured. Like I said, it could have been worse.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Aladdin oscillates madly between lock-step recitation of the animated film without the cartoon's vivacity and a tone-deaf cabal of social issues presented with a disturbingly straight face.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,A film that doesn't really bring anything new to the source material.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,"A feel-good movie, it hits a lot of the moments from the original and still expands off it a bit.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"I loved the diversity of the cast, the costumes were so well done, and the music was amazing...but the movie didn't leave me feeling anything other than apathetic by the end. It wasn't terrible, I had a good time, but I will probably never watch it again.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Technically, it's not great. Will Smith isn't the problem, but there are moments when his face is just floating all over the place, a second behind the CG...",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It's inspired at times, not always...moments of inspiration amid plodding...the placement of songs was plain and distracting.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Well, they didn't fail...the music was good, and there were many times during the numbers where I was just sitting there amazed by the extravagance.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin is a thoroughly enjoyable two hours in the cinema. And as the PG rating indicates, it's also just about the only Ritchie movie you can take your kids to.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The agility of the narration and the brilliant set up of the musical numbers draw your attention. [Full Review in Spanish],Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin isn't really about the Genie and Jasmine's handmaiden trying to make it work in this crazy world. It's about Aladdin, and the guy who plays him, Mena Massoud, is a dull singer and a wooden actor.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Forget about characterisation - everything must be loud, brash and over-the-top.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"By providing the former Fresh Prince with fresh material, Smith is able to escape the inevitable comparisons to Robin Williams. But if the film works magic with the Genie, it fails miserably with Jafar.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Almost wholly devoid of any pleasures that aren't secondhand, and the firsthand pleasures of the original film are just so much better.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,Disney's newest live-action film recreates the classic and adds charm and more backstory to our favorite characters. And Jasmine rocks!,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Ritchie's film accumulates more errors than successes in its final balance, hesitant to get away from everything that made the animated film a hit pop in its time. [Full Review in Spanish]",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin wasn't perfect, but nothing will ever live up to the classic '92 version. Still, if you have a kiddo, or if you're still a big kid at heart, we certainly recommend it.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The two leads have great moments but the direction is lazy and mismatched to the content. Far too much of Will Smith's Genie feels desperate and falls flat.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin is certainly less than the sum of its parts, but the parts are all so fantastic that it doesn't always matter. This is a fun adventure and a great time. Not exactly a whole new world, but certainly one that I don't mind journeying to again.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,You get the sense that either Guy Ritchie wasn't sure what he was doing or Disney execs insisted on the film being as bright and showy as possible to distract from its flaws.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Disney's remake of  Aladdin  features human actors and digital creatures, but don't call it ""live-action."" Maladroit and overlong, its resting state is moribund.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"This is not the unmitigated disaster most people were preparing themselves for. It is, by and large, an entertaining companion to the original animated film, with Ritchie elevating the material just enough to make the effort worthwhile.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,'Aladdin' sings with female empowerment.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"As a whole, the film chalks up to being just fine. Would I watch it again? Sure. But I think the film's real gold comes from how children will receive it, especially children of a Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) background.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Succeeds on the talents of its attractive, charismatic cast and the focused efforts of director Gut Ritchie.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The film had a tough predecessor to live up to, and it simply isn't as vibrant or joyous as its 1992 counterpart, nor does it do anything creative enough to justify its existence.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Ultimately, Disney's Aladdin is not a perfect movie. However, the film does hit all the right notes when it comes to nostalgia and representation. The film is bubbly and fun, a bright spot in what can often be a dark world.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"... more Indian influence to craft a Sinbad-like fantasy Arabia, the live-action remake is intent upon entertaining all audiences while stepping on as few sandaled toes as possible.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It puts a spotlight on the cartoon's issues, but can't quite fix them in a satisfactory way. [It] becomes a nice companion piece to the other rather than improvement.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Fun, colorful, pure and joyful...as a country, we need this movie right now.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,Guy Richie manages to recreate most of the magic found in the original thanks to a committed and talented cast and crew.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Everything about Aladdin is big, and yet feels small at the same time. Its lavish production design and costuming also has the effect of looking more like a stage production than an epic movie.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Massoud's parkour-practising Aladdin and Naomi Scott's glass-ceiling-smashing Princess Jasmine aren't really allowed space to develop readings of the roles when Smith is due to pop out of a lamp at any moment to murder a song or flog a comedy routine,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin can't fully avoid the specter of Robin Williams hovering over the film, but Will Smith makes the right choices, chief among them trading manic for laid-back.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,It's bizarre in a way that's sometimes funny-bad and sometimes just bad-bad.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"There are parts that are pretty bad, but if you want to take your kids to see it, you won't be bored. The film adds very little to the original, and seems like just another cash grab from Disney.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/aladdin,The recently released live-action remake of the movie captures some of the magical qualities of the original because of the performance of Will Smith as the genie and a talented team of special effects conjurers.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Despite my blue Will Smith-fuelled reservations about the film, I was immediately transported to my childhood living room and began to lap up the buzz of the Kingdom Of Agrabah with the same enthusiasm of an easily amused four-year-old.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The music is very good, and it features a couple of actors who can really sing those memorable songs well. Aladdin has exceptional music because most of its songs were written at a time when Walt Disney Pictures had some exceptional musical talent.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"[It] turned out to be about as mediocre as I feared, some surface pleasures notwithstanding.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,A spectacularly tedious and unimaginative film.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"As for Big Will? It's a double-edged sword. It's completely unfair to criticise him for not being Robin Williams, however in a movie designed in Disney labs to tug at your nostalgia, you can't help but compare.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,...a somewhat needless (though relatively painless) live-action update.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin is everything it had to be, and yet, like our conflicted hero, we'll no doubt wish it could have been more.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin surpasses previous Disney remakes with its unique aesthetic and welcome updates to the original, but some aspects still hold it back from true greatness.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Fun-time singalong - four stars of family entertainment.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Guy Ritchie's remake is mediocre, time filling fodder and that's about the best compliment I can give it.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Arguably Disney's best live-action adaptation to date.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"None of the filmmaking or acting really conveys that wonder of discovery; of falling in love. It's a facsimile of that feeling; a not-so-cheap copy. And, weirdly enough, it inspired in me only a small sense of loneliness.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"It's fine... A very straightforward, big spectacle musical.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"""Aladdin"" delivers the goods, especially when the music is playing, and while it may not be exactly what you wished for, it's close enough.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"The film is breathless, while never taking a breath, and when everything is big, brassy, and bold, even a manic genie has trouble standing out.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Thankfully, Aladdin is not a shot-for-shot remake, which gives Ritchie room to provide his own unique take. In turn, he incorporates little touches amid clever chase scenes and entertaining dialogue to lift the film.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,My wish is that this would have been a better movie. The Disney whimsy and magic is lacking in Aladdin.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,You can never unsee dance sequences directed by Guy Ritchie.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The design is gawdy without the joy of camp. The pacing is manic. The editing is bizarre.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"An unsubtle, fast-moving film with plenty of jokes and a visual style that would suit a themed Las Vegas hotel, it's certainly not an all-time Disney great, but I can see it being a half-term hit.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,An unimaginative remake that can be entertaining but feels empty and forgettable.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,There's enough here to make the film stand out on its own. Whether it stands out for the right reasons is up to the viewer.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Aladdin shows superior technical craftsmanship in so many aspects of the film, but its failure to reckon with a change of medium, bungling of story, and underwhelming characters, means that it is ultimately unsatisfying.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Will Smith puts a fun spin on proceedings. He brings his ""A"" game, which we haven't seen in some of his recent outings.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,This live-action version of the Disney animated classic does a very good job capturing most of what made the original magical ... while expanding on the story and the characters.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"Sure, it's almost exactly like the animated version, but they gave Jasmine the feminist edge that was sorely lacking in the cartoon.",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,This is one film that we would watch for the sake of it but come out of the theatre wishing for the good ol' days.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,The production was so focused on making us remember the past that it did little to make the present memorable.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,Ritchie leaves behind his trademark slow downed style of editing in favour of some questionable speeded up dance sequences which look cheap and badly edited in the flamboyancy of imagination clearly taken from Bollywood.,Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/aladdin,"A nostalgic magic carpet ride that might not be ""a whole new world"" of original filmmaking, but is a welcome familiar world after the depressing downer ""Dumbo"" (2019).",Aladdin,"['Action & Adventure', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
