m/10004659-arthur,The bucolic wonder buried in Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles has been snuffed out by this alienating and dislikable animated film. As overproduced and acrid as The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc and The Fifth Element.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,Besson drags things out considerably for his young audience at 122 minutes. The CG work is clever but cannot measure up to Pixar's standards in cleverness or imagination. Nothing is fresh here.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,Besson ... even dresses up the main female character in the sort of action-babe getup assigned to Milla Jovovich in his own The Fifth Element.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"The film touts its 'dazzling' hybrid of live action and 'groundbreaking' CGI, but the visuals can't compare to Happy Feet or any Pixar release.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,The underground adventures are an unfortunate mixture of po-mo snark and potty humor (some just plain pot humor as well).,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Ultimately, Besson has made an interesting, if shaky in places, homage to childhood.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Luc Besson, the most-Hollywoodish of Gallic directors, has adapted his own series of popular (in France) kid-lit tomes to produce a glossy, expensive ($84 million) and long-winded mix of live action and computer animation.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"A mishmash with a distinctive but disorderly animation palette whose top-notch voice cast -- including Robert De Niro, Madonna and David Bowie -- gets lost in the muck.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,... a stiff affair that mixes overripe live action and starchy CGI animation.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"This children's epic is slowed considerably by a convoluted, multi-tiered plotline in which we bounce between the human world and the Minimoy one. None of the characters are compelling, despite the star-studded vocal cast behind them.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"There's no time to sort out the players or the story as things rush ahead at an overwrought pace.

m/10004659-arthur,This mix of computer animation and live action promises much but never really comes together. Haphazard voice dubbing and lack of originality don't help.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"The adventure turns out to be a drag. When Arthur goes on a ruby hunt, the movie shifts to animation, and he meets the Minimoys, fairy creatures who look like those troll dolls that become inexplicably popular every 20 years.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Arthur and the Invisibles makes an excellent case against casting animated movies with celebrity voices. There are people who make their living as voiceover artists, and they would have been infinitely better than the lackluster Robert De Niro.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Luc Besson has never been one of my favorite filmmakers, but he seems to have found his metier in children's fantasy, and this semianimated adventure is enjoyable and imaginative despite its formulaic qualities.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"Succumbing to the in-joke trend popular in children's films, Luc Besson's visually attractive movie spoils its own fantasy spell with anachronistic references and a quickly resolved story line.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"While technically polished and adequately executed Arthur, like most of Besson's movies, is a strangely soulless experience.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Besson is a pro when it comes to action movies, but this part live, part animation effort is a mess, highlighted by creepy animation, derivative plot points and a child star who speaks way too fast.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"The story [Besson] co-wrote for Arthur is workable, even clever at times, but the visualization of the Minimoys and their crib is weird and almost aggressively off-putting -- like an episode of When CGI Attacks!",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,The film jumps and starts all over the place and simply isn't cohesive enough to appeal much beyond youngsters.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy who shrinks to microscopic size to find his missing grandfather.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"There's a reason American animated filmmakers don't use the great Robert De Niro, Jason Bateman and Madonna to voice their cartoons. These big names add nothing to this frustrating goulash of fairy tales and fantasy-film ingredients.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,This kids' cartoon from France is such a surreally demented attempt to connect with children that it's the equivalent of foie gras breakfast cereal or a bleu cheese milkshake.,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"It might have been just another humdrum children's film if not for Highmore, who brings the same charm he did in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Finding Neverland to this fun movie.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Directed by Luc Besson, this inventive family movie sets up the most delightful premise, then squanders it on the kind of yawn-inducing CG adventure you might expect from one of those long, plot-heavy cut scenes that slow down video games.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"They look like a cross between anime and Jim Henson puppets. Fortunately, they look nothing like Pixar, PDI, Sony Animation or any of the other talking animal companies.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Apparently Besson became so enamored of CG animation's possibilities that he forgot basic rules ... such as the one about animation thriving on clear-cut, distinctive characters whose personalities are established in the first few seconds they're on screen.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"The movie is too long by half for its relatively simple plot. And letting kids get antsy, as any parent can tell you, is the biggest sin a filmmaker can commit.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Arthur and the Invisibles may be a tale for children, but it's got the bad habits of a profligate adult -- the thing borrows shamelessly from its betters and then pretends to be self-sustaining.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"An odd imp of a movie, Arthur and the Invisibles may actually be filled with a bit too much invention for the average kid.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"
m/10004659-arthur,"Too eccentric for kids, too silly for everyone else, it floats in a Neverland of breathtaking visuals in service of a story that pilfers everything (and I mean everything) from the Arthur legends to last summer's The Ant Bully.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"The movie bing-bing-bings all over the place, repurposing fantasy novels, video games, Arthurian legends. Besson's grocery bill for all I know. Even the musical score has multiple-personality disorder.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"I know this is supposed to be a children's fantasy and that the color of the Miminoys' skin should be less remarkable than their microscopic stature, but the message seems to be that an African tribe can't be cute unless it is also white.",Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),"['Animation', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10004659-arthur,"Highmore has been given a free pass from Besson to act his little heart out, and this gifted kid has decided to use the Dakota Fanning 3000 method of predictable, robotic child acting.

m/10004659-arthur,Arthur and the Invisibles has a story so psychedelic that each movie ticket purchased should also include a black light poster and some incense.

m/10004659-arthur,"Luc Besson has made a fair share of artfully bad movies.

m/10008502-christmas_carol,"This Carol has a worse identity crisis than Scrooge. Clinging to the novel, the film tries to break out of its insular theatrics to propel Scrooge and his supernatural helpmates into outer space, as if in takeoff into a different sci-fi comic book movie.",Disney's A Christmas Carol,"['Animation', 'Drama', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/10008502-christmas_carol,"Bob Hoskins looks just right as kind old Mr. Fezziwig, but that may be more of a testament to the actor's physiognomy than to the motion-capture process, which makes most of the film's cast look like they just sauntered out of Madame Tussauds.",Disney's A Christmas Carol,"['Animation', 'Drama', 'Kids & Family', 'Science Fiction & Fantasy']"

m/anomalisa,Anomalisa is 90 minutes of contempt for life that refuses to find anything good in the world. It's a movie that makes you happy to get back to reality. It's also a movie that makes you feel very sorry for the man who made it.,Anomalisa,"['Animation', 'Comedy', 'Drama']"

m/anomalisa,"A late-breaking dream sequence is perhaps a slice of Kaufman too far, threatening to derail this beautiful journey through its sheer lack of subtlety - thankfully though, a compelling, hugely affecting final sequence brings it all back with panache.",Anomalisa,"['Animation', 'Comedy', 'Drama']"
m/anomalisa,"In choosing a medium that distances audience from onscreen subject, Kaufman has drawn the two closer together, telling a universal human story with puppets.",Anomalisa,"['Animation', 'Comedy', 'Drama']"
m/anomalisa,A somewhat cynical yet thought provoking stop motion animated film.,Anomalisa,"['Animation', 'Comedy', 'Drama']"

m/bolt,"The digital comedy-adventure starts out pretty slow and never really finds its footing, especially in regards to its needed comic edge.",Bolt,"['Action & Adventure', 'Animation', 'Comedy']"

m/bolt,"Disney's holiday tentpole is an engaging, solid effort. Its primary fault? Being released the same year as WALL%u2022E.",Bolt,"['Action & Adventure', 'Animation', 'Comedy']"

m/bolt,"Its script is smart, its conceit a heart-tugger in the finest of senses, and it's the first Disney effort in way too long to be more concerned with being a movie than with being a breeding ground for product tie-ins.",Bolt,"['Action & Adventure', 'Animation', 'Comedy']"
m/bolt,"Make a little room Lady, Tramp and all you Dalmatians, Disney's got a new animated dog to bark about.",Bolt,"['Action & Adventure', 'Animation', 'Comedy']"

m/bolt,There really isn't anything terribly fresh nor distinctive here.,Bolt,"['Action & Adventure', 'Animation', 'Comedy']"
