m/10004504-ultraviolet,"Jovovich, who's shown sensitivity in her dramatic work, looks spectacularly bored as she power-kicks her way through one bloody pile-up after another.

m/1br,"Real-life details culled from ex-members' accounts of life in groups like Scientology and NXIVM give the film an edgy ripped-from-the-headlines quality, as well as reinforcing the sheer L.A. of it all.",1BR,['Horror']

m/1br,Marmor's film is a very modern fable.,1BR,['Horror']

m/1br,Where David Marmor's film works best is with its twisty narrative and thematic underpinnings. 1BR is a constantly shifting nightmare that surprises at every turn,1BR,['Horror']

m/1br,Very stressful and intense experience...,1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,"There are many horror movies being made that are utterly predictable, but 1BR does not have that problem. The ending is chillingly haunting and will stay with viewers long after seeing this movie.",1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,"As a character trying to hold onto her morality and humanity while surviving in an unfathomable situation, Bloom plays Sarah with surprising strength in a believable arc that elevates the source material beyond its modest concept and financing.",1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,Apartment 1BR is a decent addition to the 'mad cult' subgenre with good direction from Marmor that keeps a rather predictable story interesting before arriving at a 'love it or hate it' ending.,1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,"1BR takes a ""road well traveled"" premise and turns it on it's head with a unique change in trajectory, with plenty of blood and emotion. Nicole B Bloom carries a heavy load. You can't help but feel sorry for her, root for her, and question her throughout.",1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,"1BR is a film which uses some familiar horror elements, but handles them with such sensitivity, economy and awareness that it's a genuinely effective, unbearably tense ride.",1BR,['Horror']

m/1br,"As a production plagued by disasters, the film comes out unscathed. Resisting the trend of other films of the same genre, the story and characters really explore the fact that real horror is other people no matter where you find yourself.",1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,"By forcing us to confront the seductiveness of conformity as well as its dangers, writer-director David Marmor paints a fresh picture of old themes.",1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,"David Marmor's ""1BR"" is a nasty, clever good time with a touch of Shyamalan (in a good way) and a fine performance from newcomer Nicole Brydon Bloom.",1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,"The film as a whole is too inconsistent to come anywhere close to genre film greatness, but greatness is absolutely hiding within it.",1BR,['Horror']
m/1br,"Bloom, in what should be her big break, gives us nothing to hold onto, little to root for and a passive turn that is partly how the character is written but mainly the blank-faced range of the heroine.",1BR,['Horror']

m/annabelle,"Laughworthy bumps in the night, creaky rocking chairs, a demon-infested basement and more gliding baby carriages than an '80s De Palma film.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"You have to expect a certain camp factor when the movie is about a haunted doll. They should have embraced it, owned it and exploited it.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"An excellent prequel to The Conjuring, this frightfest, beautifully directed by John R. Leonetti, takes us back to the early 1970s for an nerve-jangling, first-class haunting stuffed to the gills with old-school spookery.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"A tedious, strictly superficial fright-flick....",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"If you can identify with John and Mia-who seem to be named for the actors who played the lead couple in ""Rosemary's Baby""-then this is a movie that will have you on edge.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"A yawningly empty movie, the epitome of brainless, heartless, soulless, shameless cash-grab corporate filmmaking.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,A mediocre horror flick that can't hold a candle to the one that inspired it...a sort of catch-all of horror movie cliches.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"...(just) enough atmosphere and original scares to satisfy your Halloween craving...let's have a REAL case file from the Warrens for the next film installment, shall we?",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,Annabelle ranks as one of the most entertaining Hollywood horror outings of the year.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"A neatly packaged prequel which is better than it deserves to be thanks to a convincing performance from the aptly named Annabelle Wallis, and a couple of genuinely frightening set-pieces.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Dull-witted, stiff, and predictable.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,Want to know what's really scary about Annabelle? Its staggering lack of imagination.,Annabelle,['Horror']

m/annabelle,"Annabelle, who takes an hour to stand upright, will go down as the laziest devil-doll in movie history; compared to her, Chucky's a Harvard MBA prospect.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"A couple of good jumps but this Conjuring spin-off is led down by poor writing, anodyne leads and and overwhelming sense of familiarity.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"As the cheap shocks are ramped up, the film's ablility to genuinely disturb recedes.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"This superfluous prequel is just as needless and unnecessary as it sounds, as what can only be described as a meagre counterpart to its originator.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Every expense, basically, has been spared that might have imbued Annabelle with formidable qualities as an agent of evil. She's just a glorified prop, an excuse for bad things to happen to uninteresting people.",Annabelle,['Horror']

m/annabelle,Leonetti's The Conjuring spinoff is arguably the best demon doll prequel ever made. It is also good.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,What about this movie is supposed to scare us?,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Annabelle works reasonably well in the first half, building up a nice sense of impending dread. It borrows heavily from Rosemary's Baby before turning to a by-the-numbers litany of standard shock tactics.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"The set-pieces are effectively handled, with a few goose-bump moments along the way, but the story makes no sense whatsoever.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,This film is very much stock schlock.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,Why would you want a doll looking as ugly as that in your collection in the first place?,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"The Polanski rips begin with the obvious (having a couple named Mia and John, as in Farrow and Cassavetes, is about as blatant as you can get) and continue throughout, to an annoying degree.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Well acted, slickly produced and will make you jump - such a shame it somehow adds up to less than the sum of its parts.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,That creepy grinning doll from The Conjuring gets its own origin story in this disappointingly banal supernatural spin-off.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Cynical, forgettable and vastly inferior to Curse Of Chucky.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"The scares are orchestrated with more flair than usual, even if the best of them are all spoiled in the trailer.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,The toy in this prequel to agreeable period horror The Conjuring could hardly seem more sinister if it had presented Top of the Pops during the 1970s,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"The demonic doll from The Conjuring gets her own unsubtle, repetitive horror flick.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"The script, by Gary Dauberman, is a clichd mess, lacking humor and surprises. But Leonetti stages some fright-worthy sequences ...",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,Quality is often irrelevant in a horror movie; shock is the key.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,It's a few good shock effects and a lot of ho-hum.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Like the titular doll, this thing's off the shelf.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"All in all, Annabelle is well-made and contains a few moments that might look great out of context, but its story is too thin to recommend this to anyone but hardcore fans of The Conjuring.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Useless, completely useless: clumsily made and criminally underwritten.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"There are some moderate frights, but the presence of the doll was creepier in spurts in this film's predecessor than it is as a dramatic centerpiece.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,...a slightly above average yet run-of-the-mill ghost story...,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Those hoping for a toy-goes-mental rampage a la the Child's Play franchise will be sobered to discover Leonetti keeps his creepiest asset stationary for most of the time, which hardly seems to be in the spirit of things.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"An average kind of horror story, 'Annabelle' is a prequel to the far superior 'The Conjuring' from last year.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Clichd lines and predictable encounters, always signalled by the score, mount. The flick becomes more and more like the Child's Play (Chucky) franchise meets Rosemary's Dolly meets late-period Mad Men.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"In the end it's only half baked, dull, and lacking the heart and soul of ""The Conjuring.""",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"For much of its running time, Annabelle is so bereft of ideas for scare tactics that when the doll isn't involved, it's hard to differentiate it from any other domestic horror movie that's ever come out.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Watching Annabelle is like watching a movie you've seen a dozen times before, just with different actors and slight variations on the same scare tactics.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"We could chat all day about how ""Annabelle"" lifted (even stole) bits from better films. But, that would take away from the net effect of this evil doll movie. ""Annabelle"" is a very good horror film, originality be damned.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,Annabelle's problems are legion but let's start with the bait-and-switch hook that promises a killer doll and instead delivers a shadowy gargoyle.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Annabelle, at its heart, feels like it should be part of an anthology collection, clocking in at twenty or thirty minutes, instead of at feature length.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"In the hands of a better creative team, an all-Annabelle film might have been a grand slam. Here it's a bloop single, narrowly avoiding a tag out on the basepaths.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"I will say that Annabelle offered some good scares. Nothing astonishingly new or unique, but effective - which is surprisingly hard to do, it seems.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"An outline of a horror film rather than the full embodiment, guided by general exercises instead of ambitiously-choreographed routines.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"It will give you your money's worth, while not really serving you anything too memorable (or scary) as some of the other, more sinister horror films we've seen in the last few years.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,The best performance in the film comes from a two-year-old baby,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"The film has a good sprinkling of campy-awareness, but never chooses the laugh over the scare.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,What could have been a companion piece to The Conjuring is instead a yawn-inducing show.,Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Annabelle will likely make seasoned horror fans giggle occasionally, but it fulfills its basic genre duty -- for much of its running time, it's scary.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Nothing more than a case of a studio trying to cash in on the previous film. It's dull, predictable and really dumb.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"Annabelle is a dire effort from all involved: thoughtless, wholly uninspired and utterly unnecessary.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"ANNABELLE never comes close to the near-classic status THE CONJURING reached, but it's a fun seasonal flick.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"With no time wasted on comic relief as it takes itself surprisingly seriously, Leonetti leaves most of the heavy lifting to our own familiarity with the basic material and our lowered expectations with carbon copy.",Annabelle,['Horror']
m/annabelle,"If you think making a feature-length movie out of the backstory of a sinister doll might be stretching the concept a bit thin, you are correct.",Annabelle,['Horror']

m/annabelle_comes_home,"Annabelle seems to be on the same shoot-it-all-in-a-day schedule as Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson.

m/blair_witch,"Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett may not reinvent the Blair Witch, but they definitely prove that it can still be scary.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"The idea that a secret sequel could bring a long-stale franchise like this back to life is, frankly, the most surprising thing to happen to horror in ages.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,Blair Witch honors its tradition and uses all the tricks filmmakers have learned in the past 17 years to make us scared of the woods again.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Some will laud it, others will loathe it, but make no mistake: Blair Witch is that game-changer horror fans desperately have been waiting for.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Compared to the ill-fated ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 -- the first follow-up which was rushed to market for financial reasons -- this new iteration still comes across as downright inspiring.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Adam Wingard crafted a relentlessly creepy affair that is a perfect tribute to its revolutionary originator, but also takes the story in some frightening new directions.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Blair Witch undoubtedly passes the scare test, as for any apprehensions that may exist, what isn't in question is the sheer consistency of the scares.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Once it becomes evident that this movie is just the 1999 version done with an electric guitar instead of an acoustic, all tension is shot.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"'Blair Witch' is well crafted, and at times incredibly scary, but the woods aren't as terrifying when you've already walked through them.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Blair Witch brings a jolt of energy to a legendary horror franchise, making for a respectful and uniquely haunting chapter.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Avoid this film at all costs. If you later find that any of your friends or family actually liked this movie, then we suggest you disassociate yourself from them, and avoid them at all costs too, as they will only disappoint you somewhere down the line.",Blair Witch,['Horror']

m/blair_witch,"It's an intense, imaginative piece of work - which treads over familiar ground but modestly ventures a bit further in the climax ...",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"If The Blair Witch Project signalled a new dawn of horror, Blair Witch is the loud death rattle of a once exciting sub-genre, disappearing into the darkness.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"A significantly more accomplished and entertaining sequel than 2000's woeful cash-in Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, [this] nonetheless reps something of a missed opportunity.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"By sticking so slavishly to the original Blair Witch film's template, the result is a dull retread rather than a full-on reinvention, enlarging the cast numbers this time but sticking to the same basic beats.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"If you must reboot a classic, this is how you do it.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"It [has] the best, most terrifying climax to a horror movie in a long time.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,Wingard and Barrett's surprise - and surprisingly strong - sequel earns its scares. An effective follow-up to a film that can't be matched.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"...yet another technically competent, above average but oddly unambitious rehash of a story we've seen many times before.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"It's a film that not only goes back to the basics, but seems to deliberately steal much of what made the original such a horrific treat.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"The set-up is the same, and while that felt fresh in the first film, it now just kind of drains the piece of tension because we know no one is making it out alive.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"The only interesting new twist in the new ""Blair Witch,"" though, is what it says about franchises. And what it says about franchises isn't very interesting.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Even though is superior to its infamous prequel, this film is a boring experience. [Full review in Spanish]",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"With nothing new to add to the ""Blair Witch"" mythos, this is one found footage movie that should have been left lost in the woods.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Effectively scary and occasionally inventive, Blair Witch is a solid genre film both helped and hindered by its franchise's place in cinematic history.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Blair Witch styles itself as a love-letter, but it's pure transcription.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Gone is any realism, washed away by a camera-friendly cast who wrestle with the piss-poor melodrama when they're not mugging the cameras capturing the prized footage, which must have been plopped down on the porch of whoever used to edit MTV's Fear.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,The quality on offer in Blair Witch rises markedly once we are sure night is falling for what will be the very last time.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,Blair Witch is at its best when it's honoring what has come before.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Wingard's inclusion of subgenres (a dash of Cronenberg body horror; a smattering of sci-fi) steers the film in an unexpectedly bold new direction, justifying its existence on its own merit.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,sets a new standard for found-footage horror with a story that hews to the tropes of the original and yet is a fresh hell of imagination and primal fear.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Even if there were no witches in the world, these idiots would probably get taken out crossing a busy street.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Barrett and Wingard guide us on a slightly different path, but it's clear early on that the destination will be all too familiar.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,It doesn't suggest documentary footage found in the woods so much as a haunted-house version of Hardcore Henry.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"At least a third of ""Blair Witch"" consists of people running through the woods with flashlights, shouting out each other's names. A little of this goes a long way.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"""Blair Witch"" is no ""The Blair Witch Project""few films arebut it is a worthy, affectionate follow-up with nerve-blistering apprehension to spare. By the end, even the most hardened audience members are apt to get a case of the jitters.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,An entirely superfluous attempt to recapture the magic of the original film. A remake masquerading as a sequel that goes nowhere and has nothing new to say.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Perhaps these woods' biggest surprise is their proximity to the original's formula, despite 16 intervening years.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"There's a sharp division between the chill of ""I think I just saw something!"" and the confusion of ""I don't know what the hell I just saw!"" and ""Blair Witch"" often falls on the wrong side.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,Awful on an epic scale.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Takes a while to get going, but it pays off in the last act, when all hell finally breaks loose and we're treated to a spookhouse full of sustained, mostly dialogue-free terror.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"The Blair Witch returns, but this sequel isn't as effective as the original. Still, Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett add enough variety to make it rewarding.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"The Blair Witch Project inexplicably gave the whole world sleepless nights in 1999 but the latest sequel, imaginatively entitled Blair Witch, is unlikely to have a similar impact.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"It's better than most shaky-cam films, including the original.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Alas, when one character announces the group has been walking round in circles, it foreshadows a finalé that simply offers a more amped up version of everything we've seen before.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"As the final moments close in around the viewer, you may yet find yourself holding your breath, and conceding that all Wingard's technical nous is at least good for something.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Running and screaming may be essential to a lot of horror movies, but as ""Blair Witch"" shows, they're not scary in themselves. For that, you need the stuff between the running and screaming.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"The most puzzling mystery of Blair Witch has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of this supposed sequel, and everything to do with why a promising director the caliber of Adam Wingard would want to be helming this film in the first place.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Wingard is a good director, but his discipline in composing his shots paradoxically hurts the movie. [Full review in Portuguese.]",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"It's literally hard to watch, as copious amounts of blurry handheld footage and bright lights shone directly into the camera prove to be an endurance test for the eyeballs.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"While this sequel is more entertaining than its predecessor, it simply can't capture the mystique of the original.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"The filmmakers are too talented to make anything less than an efficient thrill machine, and the movie delivers bouncy Friday night horror flick jolts.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,The acting and filmmaking are too crude to make you care about what happens ... even though you know pretty much exactly what that will be.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Tedious in its early going and all but unwatchable in its final half-hour, the movie feels interminable at a barely-feature-length 89 minutes.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Even if the movie doesn't do anything new, it shows that when talented filmmakers pool their talents and give a project their all even the most tired of subjects and stylistic choices can suddenly feel fresh.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,Blair Witch is a terrific sequel that stays true to the spirit of the original while at the same time developing and expanding upon the legend.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,This new Blair Witch may not have all the electricity of the original classic -- what movie could? -- but the fact that the filmmakers come close is shocking in its own right.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Blair Witch uses our technological advances to its clever advantage; the characters are equipped with cameras and tracking devices. There's even a drone. Unfortunately, that's where the cleverness ends.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,It's a hallmark of this not-particularly-scary film's failure that the blows to the electronics feel somehow more visceral.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"It's nothing more than a sophisticated clone of the original, and it really overdoes the shaky-camera thing - even more than in some of the worst found-footage movies The Blair Witch Project spawned.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"""Blair Witch"" runs only eight minutes past the original, yet it feels about a half-hour longer.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,This sequel gets progressively messy while The Blair Witch Project grew progressively taut.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Nausea-provoking camerawork, cacophonous sound design and incoherent editing assault the senses nonstop. The only thing that could make watching this movie more unpleasant is if ushers tasered viewers at random intervals.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,Blair Witch's comparatively maximalist approach shows too much and scares too little.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"All in all, Blair Witch was quite satisfying and made me think: This is what the first sequel to the original film should have accomplished.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"It switches between so many points of view, we can't help wondering who has edited this ""found"" footage - and why their grasp of horror is so slack.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"While Blair Witch does have a few moments of tension and dread, it simply doesn't recapture the once-in-a-lifetime terror that made the original film so unforgettable.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Blair Witch manages to strike a balance between pleasing the fans of the 1999 found-footage film and working as a Friday night at the multiplex, mainly by sticking to the principle that what you don't see will always be scarier.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Blair Witch suffers from expanding on an already-told story and filling in the blanks that the original intentionally left, well, blank.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Certainly better than the first sequel but not as effective at inducing terror and fright as the original flick. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Violence, Scares, etc. - also Available)",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Ultimately, perhaps unavoidably, unsatisfying.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Padded by too many lame jump scares to count, Blair Witch becomes a near-literal remake of its predecessor once the group enters the fateful woods.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,The same old haunting in the same old woods with a same old cast of shortsighted witch hunters.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Blair Witch has all the bells and whistles of an effective horror film, without delivering on the originality and general terror of its predecessor.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Wingard and Barrett aren't trying to reinvent the wail here, which is mostly a good thing.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"The film's well crafted but bereft of any new ideas, moving the series' mythology forward by perhaps all of a millimeter.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"""Blair Witch"" comes to the party very late and very tired, and it doesn't improve from there.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"While it doesn't recapture the black magic of the original, it delivers the requisite terror in the last half-hour after a slow and ambiguous start.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,Was I supposed to be scared by this thing?,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,It administers its jolts with impeccable timing and may well satisfy those who felt swindled by the hype surrounding the much-more-suggestive original.,Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Wingard's movie, for all its abundant mischief, doesn't trust the power of its own illusion. You can see these woods a lot more clearly now, and what you see is that you've been here before.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Without real innovation or story evolution, ""Blair Witch"" becomes a trip down a rabbit hole of misery and suffering. Life's too short - especially in these woods.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"At a relatively compact 89 minutes, the picture still feels about 20 minutes too long thanks to all the repetition of familiar elements.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Wingard's sequel-slash-remake delivers some decent scares, but it falls short of inducing the abject terror of the original.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Wingard and Barrett's previous films are told with style, wit, and energy that amount to a voice uniquely their own. That voice is sorely missed here.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Blair Witch is nothing but a pale imitation of The Blair Witch Project -- void of all creativity and originality. It's so bad, it manages what should have been impossible and is far worse than Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"If The Blair Witch Project had the power to trouble your sleep, the rote replications of Blair Witch may just induce it.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"Alas, Blair Witch is another carnival of jump-scares: the new found-footage is the same as the old found-footage, despite the technological leaps.",Blair Witch,['Horror']
m/blair_witch,"[It's] directed and scored by Adam Wingard and scripted by Simon Barrett, the duo whose 2014 The Guest actually managed to be violent, creepy and scary.",Blair Witch,['Horror']

m/brick,"It may be a little predictable, but it gets points for style and for making the effort to be different.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,You can't deny the fellow who made it has talent.,Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"

m/brick,"Brick is kinda brilliant and kinda demented, and you love it for the former far more than you hold the latter against it.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,"The action is raw and immediate. The film is unsettling to look at, all bathed in a cool blue light and with an intensity about everything that will remind you, and not in a pleasant way, of how large the world looms when one really is in high school.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"

m/brick,"If Brick isn't totally successful, it does make Johnson a director to watch.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"

m/brick,The enormously entertaining Brick blows you away with its artful reinvigoration of a popular filmmaking genre.,Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,"The mystery feels elementary and his characters, though compelling as sketches, remain one-dimensional from the first to the last good-looking frame.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,Brick is almost fiendish in its insistence on finding modern-day parallels to classic pulp-fiction figures.,Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"

m/brick,Assumes that you know film noir and then that you won't mind high-schoolers trampling one of your favorite genres. An admirable attempt that falls short in the end.,Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"

m/brick,"There's no denying that Brick is weirdly expressive, often when it seems most artificial. What begins as the most gimmicky sort of genre retread somehow evolves into that most elusive of films: a personal statement.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,"a startlingly original, wholly engrossing, and brilliantly plotted piece of work",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"

m/brick,"Although Brick can be a bit thick, you have to admire the effort.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,"The relationships are unclear, the motives less so, but the idea has potential. Tries a little too hard to be hard-boiled, sacrificing development.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,The clever notion of presenting high school life with the artificiality of a high school play isn't compelling in practice.,Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,"Brick is smart -- perhaps too smart for its own good at times. But in the end, its affectations add up to entertainment.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"
m/brick,"I felt like I was watching a bad film school rehash of Godard in the most contrived manner.

m/brick,"While Brick is chock-full of the characters, language and imagery of classic noir, it is in fact set among contemporary teenagers. It's a gimmick, but it's a damn fine gimmick.",Brick,"['Action & Adventure', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery & Suspense']"

m/carrie,"While it's tempting to be cynical about a remake of a film that gave the much maligned horror genre a rare moment of real prestige, dare to judge Peirce's version on its own merits and you might just be frightened at how well it measures up.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Peirce's Carrie is not as accomplished but still feels more substantial than most contemporary teen horror films. It's well-acted, insidiously creepy and sufficiently bloody, if you're into that.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Given [Peirce's] penchant for bullied characters and her overall female perspective, this pairing makes startling sense.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The story of Carrie innately works, so it's not that this movie needed to change what happens - it just feels too dependent on telling it in the exact way De Palma did.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"While it might not have been necessary, the Carrie remake is still an adept, entertaining, and at times downright haunting, piece of filmmaking.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Comparisons to the 1976 original are inevitable. Carrie is a first-rate horror movie. Period. And that goes for 1976 and 2013.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Kimberly Peirce's Carrie succeeds because of young Chloë Grace Moretz and her immensely talented character creation, bringing her own unique spark of life to Carrie White.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Carrie understands the natural desire of an audience to want to see revenge acted out on bullies, and is content to be what is essentially a superhero origin story.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"For the most part, this is a solid adaptation of [Stephen] King's work that honors the source material.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,There's a lot to like in this remake. It's sincerely interested in exploring the pain that its characters suffer and inflict.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Moore is terrifying as a guilt-addled true believer, and Moretz caresses her role when she gets the chance. And the hot topics do indeed remain hot.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Right now [Moretz] doesn't have Spacek's extensive emotional vocabulary, and since all the movie's psychology and emotion are funneled through her character, the movie often feels flat.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Nothing but a fancy bit of corporate Hollywood graverobbing - slipping into the copyright cemetery, digging up a generous loved one, and calmly stripping her of every bit of gold and silver they can pawn.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,This is pretty much the same film as before. That's not necessarily a bad thing as the story still works and certainly remains relevant. (Full Content Review for Parents also available),Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"'Carrie' is not a particularly terrible remake, but it does expose the flaws of the source material as opposed to rising above them the way the original did.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"There's definitely something in the pig's blood of Stephen King's tale of bullying, religious fanaticism, telekinesis and menstruation.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"While this updated remake may bring in a new audience, it offers little surprises, little effect, and pales in comparison to the original.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Just another rehash, both slavishly devoted to DePalma's original, and lacking any of that film's style. Watch the older movie or read the book instead.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"There is no 'good' reason to revisit the story, except for the most important one: It's a really damn fine story.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Kimberly Peirce's new adaptation of the classic Stephen King novel is a grave but listless thriller.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"In the age of social media and cyber-bullying, 'Carrie' feels more timely than it did in the '70s ... Unlike the anemic, waif-like Spacek, Moretz is empowered by her witch-y telekinetic powers.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,... hones its dramatic elements to emotional effect rather than fall back on a slasher film template... Moretz brings her A-game...,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The update reimagining is entertaining enough, but finds nothing new to say.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Updated remake misses the mark,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Chloë Grace Moretz is a wonderful Carrie, but not even her strong performance could save this failing reboot.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"It's a nearly exact copy of the original film that makes so few changes to the story that you have to wonder why they didn't just use the original screenplay and do a shot-for-shot remake along the lines of Gus Van Sant's pointless ""Psycho"" replica.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The movie is very good, both as a first-order viewing experience and as a contemporary gloss on Brian De Palma's classic 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's novel.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,...almost a textbook case study in the pitfalls of remakes.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Rather than fixing some of the problems with De Palma's approach and trying something fresh, Peirce compounds them.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"It is a timeless thing for all of us, the ritual of high-school expectation and heartache. Once again, as it did nearly 40 years ago, Carrie turns it into an experience of biblical proportions.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"... this 'Carrie' is, like the character herself, too shy and unsure, and it ends up feeling like a missed opportunity more than anything else.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,A poor rehash of the Stephen King story. Moretz is no match for the memory of Spacek's performance.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"I was expecting passive mediocrity. Instead, I got something actively bad.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"There's nothing really wrong with this iteration of Carrie, it's just that most everything that's right can't be attributed to the production itself.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Carrie has proved itself to be a remarkably resilient tale that's not likely to be plugged up anytime soon.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Bloody horror remake focuses heavily on bullying, revenge.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"A proportional response? You must not remember high school very well. Frankly, more proms should end that way.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The new ""Carrie"" begs the question: why?",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"That a remake of Carrie should turn out to be a pathetic retread of the same emotions, step-by-step, executed with far less skill and visceral punch is probably to be expected.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,It's time to stop remaking Carrie.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"New ""Carrie"" Stands on its Own",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"A purposeful revamp of Stephen King's prescient novel, updated for an era of cyberbullying, home schooling, high-school mass murder and America's so-called culture wars (De Palma referenced Norman Bates, the new movie name-drops Tim Tebow).",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"ends with what has to be the cheesiest, most inexplicably silly image of any film this year, a desperate stab at giving this retread a memorable exit that only confirms how utterly unnecessary and inferior a remake it is",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The recipe in today's reimagining of Carrie calls for the same servings of thrills and shrills, making the new film a serviceable approach to the King classic...",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,We love watching the vengeance just as much as Carrie relishes in delivering it.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"There are many ways to be the ""weird girl,"" and Moretz's preternatural self-possession is the diametrical opposite of Carrie's flailing awkwardness.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Peirce's feel for the material goes the Brian De Palma version one better.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"What makes it execrable is the way it drains the original movie of all its erotic tension, only to ramp up the final-act violence.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Kimberly Peirce's update on Stephen King's Carrie slavishly follows the path taken by Brian De Palma's 1976 film and fails to make any real impact.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"It hits [the Brian De Palma version's] every beat, but director Kimberly Peirce ... isn't mad about cinema (and cinema history) like De Palma.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Strictly by the numbers, almost absurdly faithfully, without any directorial flair, texture or point of view ... Just another remake, not as good as the original adaptation, and, therefore, ultimately... pointless.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,...a passable adaptation that fares about as well as one might've anticipated/hoped...,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"I never thought I'd say this about a high school massacre movie, but Kimberly Peirce's remake of Brian De Palma's Carrie has way too many survivors.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,A remake that doesn't see the legacy of Carrie White burn in hell. But not one that adds much to it either.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"One of the more solid '70s horror remakes, but it lacks the verve and potency, romance and heartache of the original. Still, the haircuts are a vast improvement...",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The good news is that you can't go too far wrong by copying a proven formula and for a new generation of moviegoers, it will be something different.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,I'm struck by the perversity of a story four decades old about religious misogyny and basic feminism and the perniciousness of bullying that still feels fresh and relevant...,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Chloe Moretz is unnervingly talented, but Carrie is not a role she was born to play. She hasn't a victim's bone in her body and fluffs the early scenes.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,The best thing about this worthwhile update of Brian De Palma's classic 1976 film adaptation of Stephen King's first published novel is the way it dials up the hot-button theme of bullying...And the worst thing? The film totally pikes out at the end.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Moretz replicates Laurie's pixie-featured Medusa gaze while Moore does the Spacek flayed-skull look.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"What the movie loses in kicky sensationalism, it sometimes gains in psychological nuance.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The result is efficient, but only tentatively updated to the digital age of cyberbullying and social media, and it is strangely pointless.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"A watchable, if largely forgettable remake that too often feels like a missed opportunity - the performances, direction and effects are all decent enough, but it lacks the visceral impact of the 1976 film.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Begs that age-old remake-of-a-classic question of why even bother, even if the very capable actors do the best that they possibly can.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,You would have trouble arguing for any significant shift in perspective.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,It looks uncannily at home in 2013.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"This remake of the classic 1976 horror film can't match the original, but this is still a great Stephen King story about hormonal confusion and religious fervour.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"It's perfectly watchable, but I've been more scared at a vicarage tea party.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,The special effects may have moved on over the past 40 years but virtually every other aspect of the film is inferior to its predecessor.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Effective teen horror with bags of character - think Mean Girls with buckets of blood, only maybe not quite as much of a masterpiece as that would suggest.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,This glossy modern horror refit is a pale shadow of Brian De Palma's seminal 1976 film.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The basic tune is recognisable, but it's played all wrong.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,An engaging and worthwhile new take on De Palma's blood-soaked classic.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The new Carrie is cowardly and artistically empty. If you avoid one movie this year, make it this one.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"It might be remade almost shot-for-shot, but times have changed since the `70s, and I personally think Peirce's clear agenda for updating its dominant themes is a welcome one.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,This cyber-age version didn't raise a single hair on the back of my neck.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,This is a sturdy tale that deserves to find a new audience. It's just a shame they won't find anything new in the process.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"This classic worm-turns tale rights a few of the original's wrongs and offers a sad and scary performance by Moretz, although she's almost upstaged by Moore, whose misogynist Bible-bashing is more extreme than Piper Laurie's in the original.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Feels like someone copied a schoolmate's work and added a lot of their own occasionally enlightening but largely unnecessary scribbles.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Peirce wants to make a hit, and, even with source material this strange, it feels as though she has. But if so, that's all she has made.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"It's all just a series of scenes taking from DePalma's playbook, and going through the motions.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Repeats the past with less thrilling but more profound results.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Not only doesn't Carrie add anything particularly new to the mix, it fails to stand on its own feet and cohere its somewhat disparate components.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"For all its positives, unfortunately, when the inevitable comparisons to both King, and Brian De Palma's 1976 version arise, Carrie does fall short.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Peirce's imagery is pungent: the mark of Carrie's bloody palm print on the eggshell blue of her gym teacher's skirt; a slow-motion whirling sateen dervish of a student and her gown in flames.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,A wan retelling which pales in practically every department when compared to the '76 model.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Perhaps the biggest flaw in this remake has to do with the ethereal beauty of its leading lady.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"By taking a safe, piecemeal approach -- and treating the original a sacred text rather than completely reinventing it -- the result at times seems weirdly anachronistic.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"A tired, unneeded copy of Brian De Palma's far superior work, with the small changes it makes adding nothing of significance.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Sensitively directed and powerfully acted, the new version passes muster as a different take.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"What the new Carrie lacks in original ideas, it makes up for in many other departments.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"It's a small miracle that the picture doesn't lean too heavily on one particular topic du jour - bullying - and a major miracle that it's a respectable film, to boot.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The performances and casting are suitable, but Carrie is half the film I'd hope Peirce would make of it.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Optimistically speaking, Carrie could have been worse. But the depressing truth is that it could have been so much better.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"... a big upgrade from the 1976 original, directed by Brian De Palma.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Although it cannot top Brian de Palma's 1976 movie, this retelling does allow more empathy for Carrie; she is not evil just for the heck of it. It's a case of the underdog suddenly becoming an overlord.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"It's good, gripping stuff: Moore is excellent as the pale and bedraggled cult escapee, and the storyline actually makes sense this time, with the help of some technology-assisted slut-shaming.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Many scenes are similar to the 1976 original but this update feels far more like a Mean Girls high school flick, which is actually a good thing.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"An efficient, yet prosaic supernatural thriller that does its best to rework the story to fit in with modern day audiences.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Whilst the kills and gore were mildly entertaining it was incredibly hard to sympathise with a Carrie that was fully aware of her powers and using them in violent ways as opposed to the... unaware Carrie Sissy Spacek gave us in the original.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"While [Chloe Grace Moretz] makes a believable prom queen swan, she's less convincing as an awkward ugly duckling.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Director Kimberly Peirce delivers a worthy remake to a horror classic, while offering enough changes to make it seem fairly fresh.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Watching the remake of Carrie [over the original] is like replacing your phone with a newer version of the exact same phone.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,It is certainly asking a lot to buy into the shoddy remake of Brian De Palma's 1976 macabre masterpiece Carrie. There needed to be more shock-inducing significance poured onto this callow Carrie besides the standby bucket of pig's blood,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"A near word-for-word remake... Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie is an unnecessary update with its own charm nonetheless (and 100 percent less full-frontal nudity, thankfully).",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"There is no way for this Carrie to become a classic -- it is far too close to the earlier film to escape its shadow. However, it works perfectly well and is worth seeing, except for those who abhor the whole notion of remakes.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"There are a lot of good things here: the updates Pierce added make perfect sense, I really loved the special F/X, the score is AMAZING, and the casting is gorgeous.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Pulls off the unenviable task of being both respectful to the original whilst spicing the story with enough fresh twists that it doesn't appear like a scene-by-scene retread of its forebear.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"This is a film that is all about the iconic prom sequence, which is staged well by director Kimberly Peirce, but there really isn't much more to the film.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"The ambition of Peirce, Moretz, and Moore shines through in the film's strongest moments, and though the supporting players and shaky contemporary revisions weigh the film down, Peirce deserves credit for putting up one hell of a fight.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"While this quality remake will never be regarded in the same way, it achieves all the right shocks in a majorly unsettling way.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,"Moretz plays Carrie as either a constantly petrified, meek outcast or a grimacing destroyer. Peirce fails to build a connection between audience and protagonist.",Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Why a new version? Why a remake? Why a reimagination? The answer is because this new 2013 Carrie from director Kimberly Peirce is just that - a reimagination that harkens back to the original source material - [Stephen] King's novel.,Carrie,['Horror']
m/carrie,Kimberly Peirce takes a classic film and manages to be both faithful to the original while breathing new life into it.,Carrie,['Horror']
